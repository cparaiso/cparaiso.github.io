      <description>For a bit of context, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project that spits out a YAML file that has properties with UUIDs. These UUIDs are linked to different text files and image files. The goal was to have some kind of web component consisting of an SVG with a text overlay. The text was separated out for third-party localization.
I wrote a Python script and successfully populated the YAML file with what I needed for now.</description>

      <description>I had a brain fart today. I was developing a personal project in Python and I had some library issues that I was trying to wrap my head around. It turns out, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have my virtual environment running. I completely forgot.
So then I activated it.
source .venv/bin/activate Then I thought to myself&amp;hellip;
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to type that out every single damn time.
I&amp;rsquo;m lazy. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to type unnecessary things.</description>
