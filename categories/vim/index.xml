      <description>&lt;p&gt;From working the usual 9 to 5 job on top of studying data engineering (Python, SQL, DE concepts), I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling a little burnt out with everything. I decided to take a break and revisit my development environment to see what I could add, remove or even change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. According to my dotfiles repository, it&amp;rsquo;s been about 6 years since I last updated it. This makes sense since in my &lt;code&gt;aliases&lt;/code&gt; file, the most used aliases I&amp;rsquo;ve used over the years are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be about the history of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;. This, also, is not going to be a Vim tutorial. What it will be is my experience with getting back into using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-experience&#34;&gt;My First Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 2000s while I was in college, I was approached by a classmate who mentioned that I should install and learn Linux. I decided on installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slackware.com/&#34;&gt;Slackware&lt;/a&gt; because that was the distribution everyone was suggesting to learn Linux. I had difficulties installing it but one of the hardest things I encountered was text editing with Vim. Vim was still new to me. Even using :wq! to save a file was extremely foreign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
